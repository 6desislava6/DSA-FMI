* The MAX-HEAPIFY procedure, which runs in O.lg n/ time, is the key to main-
taining the max-heap property.
* The BUILD -MAX-HEAP procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max-
heap from an unordered input array.
* The HEAPSORT procedure, which runs in O.n lg n/ time, sorts an array in
place.
* The MAX-HEAP-INSERT , HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX , HEAP-INCREASE-KEY ,
and HEAP-MAXIMUM procedures, which run in O.lg n/ time, allow the heap
data structure to implement a priority queue.*/
